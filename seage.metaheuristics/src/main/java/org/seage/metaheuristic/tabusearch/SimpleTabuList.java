/**
 * <p>
 *  This implementation of a tabu list uses the {@link Move}'s <code>hashCode()</code>
 *  method to determine the move's identity.
 *  <strong>It is imperative that you override the <code>hashCode()</code> 
 *  method with one that identifies the move appropriately for your problem</strong>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *  An <code>int</code> array is used to store the hash code values, and a simple
 *  <code>for</code> loop checks for a move's presence when {@link #isTabu isTabu(...)}
 *  is called.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *  You can resize the tabu list dynamically by calling
 *  {@link #setTenure setTenure(...)}. The data structure
 *  being used to record the tabu list grows if the requested
 *  tenure is larger than the array being used, but stays the 
 *  same size if the tenure is reduced. This is for performance
 *  reasons and insures that you can change the size of the
 *  tenure often without a performance degredation.
 * </p>
